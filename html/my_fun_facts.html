                is a science fiction novel by Ernest Cline. It takes place in the year 2045, where the world is in
                shambles and people escape their reality by playing a virtual reality game called the OASIS. The
                creator of the OASIS, James Halliday, dies and leaves his fortune to whoever can find the Easter Egg
                hidden in the game. The story follows Wade Watts, a teenager who is obsessed with the OASIS and
                Halliday, as he tries to find the Easter Egg before the evil corporation IOI does.

                <a href="https://youtu.be/7fFYtnfOdAI">Sinkholes of Darkness</a> is a song from the video game
                Terraria, and is found in the Terraria (Otherworld) Soundtrack. It plays while fighting some of the hardmode bosses when the Terraria Otherworld soundtrack is selected. Personally, I think this is one of the cooler sounding songs in the game.
